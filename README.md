## What is it?

![STERN](sternEN.png)

STERN is a multiplayer game, similar to the board game "Risk". Players control planets, and attempt to take over the galaxy by sending spaceships to other planets. At the end of the game, the player with the most planets wins.

The game is turn based. When it is your turn, enter where you want to send your spaceships. You can enter multiple moves per round. When you have entered all the moves for a round, pass on to the next player. When all moves have been entered, the computer will move the spaceships.

If you have ever played "Risk", you know how intense such a combat game can be. STERN is so addictive, not because of its spectacular graphics and sound effects - there are none at all - but because it requires communication and negotiations between the players. So invite some friends over give this game a good try. For a game with 30 rounds, you should calculate about three days with four hours per day.

Don't first-try this game with fewer than three players. If you do, you won't understand why it is any good. A great game takes four to six players with at least 28 planets.

In addition to the classic "hot seat" mode, STERN can also be played via e-mail or hosted on a server, so that the players do not necessarily have to gather around a single computer.

But the best thing is still the classic game variant, which has been around since 1989: Sit with your friends on a large couch in front of a large screen or projector, serve chips and unhealthy drinks, switch off all devices that didn't exist in the 80s and have a good time together.

For me, STERN is a hobby to try out programming techniques in my spare time and to imitate the lifecycle management of a very important open source software. I am realistic enough not to believe that STERN will be in the top 10 major game rankings. For me, STERN is a learning project that has been going on for over 30 years. Perhaps there is some intelligent life form in the vastness of the universe that shares the joy of STERN with me. If so: Please drop me a message!

Have fun playing!
